# AppRatingPrediction
The primary goal of this project is to predict app ratings in the Google Play Store using various features such as size, price, number of installs, and categorical variables. This is achieved through systematic data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and linear regression modelling to understand which factors most influence app ratings.
